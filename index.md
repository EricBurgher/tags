# Collaborating with git

## Introduction

In this two-session hands-on course, you will experience the essence of git by working in teams to improve a simple Python webapp, laying a foundation for collaborating in a professional environment.

This material has been presented to every CodePlatoon cohort since Bravo. Several graduates report that, equipped with a firm grasp of these git basics, they have become go-to git resources in their software engineering teams.

## About the instructor
As a devops professional with three-ish decades of experience in version control, I first experienced git in 2009 when developers insisted on bringing it into my company.  I learned a few basic survival commands, but it wasn't really clicking for me. Depressingly often, especially for a version control "expert", I got out of my depth and had to be rescued.  Eventually I tired of memorizing magic spells and decided to learn the basics of git once-and-for-all.  Suddenly, git started making sense!  That feeling of enlightenment inspired this course.

## In a nutshell - Three objects, Three trees
You will get lots of practice expressing your changes in terms of git's data model - **three objects** - and moving them around in git's state model - **three trees**.

The **three objects** are blob, tree, and commit.  The **three trees** are HEAD, index, and workspace.

## Tips for Success
- **Do the Prework** - The class moves fast, especially if you haven't done much with git, Bash, Peewee and/or Flask.  Doing the Prework is essential to help you keep up and get the most out of the time.
- **Stop me during the class and ask questions** - Really.  It helps me know how things are going.  And asking questions in a classroom environment, although often challenging, ends up helping others in the class.
